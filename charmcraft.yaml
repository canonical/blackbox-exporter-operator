title: Blackbox Exporter Machine Charm
summary: Performs ICMP connectivity checks of its peers by default and supports blackbox probing with a variety of protocols.

  Blackbox exporter is a Prometheus exporter that can execute blackbox
  probes for a variety of protocols, including HTTP(s), DNS, TCP and ICMP.
  This charm operates the Blackbox Exporter snap on machines such as LXD.

      It alows this charm to set up custom scrape jobs, logs, etc to be
      scraped by a `cos-agent`-requiring charm.

      description: |
        Supply a configuration file for Blackbox Exporter in which modules and their parameters are specified.
        The provided config file must be a valid YAML and contain a `modules` section.
        If this value is unset, the default below will be used.

        modules:
          http_2xx:
            prober: http
            timeout: 10s
          tcp_connect:
            prober: tcp
            timeout: 10s
          icmp:
            prober: icmp
            timeout: 10s
            icmp:
              preferred_ip_protocol: "ip4"
              ip_protocol_fallback: true
  
        Automatic connectivity checks require the ICMP module. 
        If you need automatic cross-unit connectivity checks, do NOT remove the ICMP module. 
        If your ICMP checks require DNS resolution for a target e.g. charmhub.io,
        ensure the parameter `ip_protocol_fallback` is set to `true`.
        Refer to https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md for
        more information.

        Scrape config for Opentelemetry Collector in YAML format.
        Refer to https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter#prometheus-configuration for full
        details.
        The scrape jobs defined via this option are added to the self monitoring and, if enabled, automatic
        cross-unit ICMP connectivity checks and forwarded over relation data to Opentelemetry Collector.
        An example file would be:

        scrape_configs:
        - job_name: check-charmhub-connectivity
          metrics_path: /probe
          params:
            module: [http_2xx]
          static_configs:
            - targets:
                - https://charmhub.io
                - https://ubuntu.com    

        Ensure your file starts with `scrape_configs`. Separate jobs using different job names.
        The charm will prepend its principal's hostname to the job name. For example, the job name `check-charmhub-connectivity`
        will become `<hostname>-check-charmhub-connectivity`. You can provide custom labels under the `labels` section.
        However, the charm will automatically set the following labels:
        1. source: equal to the name of the principal unit.
        2. source_hostname: equal to the hostname of the machine hosting the unit.

        Upon changing the config, the provided scrape jobs will be validated. If they are invalid, the charm
        will be set to Blocked along with a dedicated message and the provided jobs will NOT be forwarded over 
        relation data to Opentelemetry Collector.
